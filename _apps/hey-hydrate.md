App for tracking your water intake.

In late 2021 I got tired of looking at the AppStore, trying to find a water input tracker. None of the tracker apps I could find had the basic features I was looking for.
I wanted something that was very simple that you could just add the water you've drank and it would sync that with Apple Health, so all my other wellness apps would have access to the data.
I couldn't find an app that fit my needs, so I decided to make one.
