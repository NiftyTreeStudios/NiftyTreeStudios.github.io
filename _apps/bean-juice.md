A simple coffee companion app offering quick recipe calculation, saving recipes and cafe exploration.

In late 2019 I had the idea to make a simple coffee brewing app for everyone to use at home. After some market study, I found out that there multiple coffee brewing apps in the AppStore, but all of them are complex or difficult to use.

The plan was put in motion to make a simplistic app for coffee recipes. A way for beginners to start experimenting with their morning (or afternoon) cup of joe.
